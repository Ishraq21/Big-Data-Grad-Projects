# BDA594 Final Project - NFL: Implementing New Special Team Metrics and Ranking Special Team Players
This repository is my part of the final group project for BDA 594.

**Project Description**

We used NNFL data given to us to implement new metrics for Special Teams players. We took the data and ranked the Specialists, a group that is comprised of punters, kickers, and long snappers. Our main objective is to evaluate and rank the performance of the Specialists to draw new insights and uncover any findings that can potentially improve team performance.

**What I did?**

Preprocessed exploratory data and implemented predictions using a simple linear regression model created through an artificial neural network to predict metrics such as:

- Average distance a special team player can travel throughout a game.
- Determine their rate of kick success in a game.
