<h2>BDA 572 Individual Final Project - COVID19 Visualization </h2>

<h3>Project Description</h3>

This is an individual final project which is a visualization of COVID-19 data, specifically focused on California and more detailed insights into Los Angeles County. The data is sourced from the New York Times' COVID-19 dataset, which provides information on cases and deaths across US counties. The visualizations include bar plots, line plots, pie charts, scatter plots on a map, and choropleth maps.

<h3>What I did?</h3>

I imported necessary libraries and set up the environment for data visualization. I sourced COVID-19 data from the New York Times' GitHub and merged it with geographical data for US counties. After focusing on California and cleaning the data, I created various visualizations, including bar plots, pie charts, and line plots. Additionally, I used scatter plots to depict cases and deaths on a California map and a choropleth map to show the average number of deaths across California counties.

<h3>Results</h3>

The code offers visualizations detailing the spread and impact of COVID-19 in California, highlighting case distribution, time-based trends in Los Angeles, geographical hotspots, and severity across counties, with a particular emphasis on Los Angeles County.
