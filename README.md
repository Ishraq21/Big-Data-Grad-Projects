# BigData-ML-Final-Grad-Projects
This repo contains some of my graduate degree final projects from the Big Data Analytics Master's program at SDSU. You can find codes and models for the following projects:

<h2>BDA 600 Capstone Project - Forecast and Predict Crypto Trend Using Artificial Neural Network and Sentiment Analysis</h2>

My individual contribution for the BDA 600 final group capstone project.

<h3>What I Did</h3>

Implemented LSTM model for Time Series Prediction on time-varying Crypto data and Vader Sentiment Analyzer to analyze user sentiments from Twitter.

<h3>Project Objective</h3>

To provide a user-friendly and accurate tool for cryptocurrency investors by utilizing real-time API data and AI technology creating a predictive model that determines the likelihood of price fluctuations in cryptocurrencies.

<h2>LING 583 Individual Final Project- 2020 US Election Sentiment Analysis</h2>

This is my individual final project for class Linguistic 583 - Statistical Methods in Text Analysis

<h3>Data</h3>

For this project, I used the Sentiment Analysis US Presidential Elections 2020 Dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manchunhui/us-election-2020-tweets

<h3>What I did?</h3>

Pre-process and train my data using multiple different classifiers to predict the candidate from tweet text only. Furthermore, take into account the hashtags and how they are related to a certain candidate alongside the tweet texts to analyze the user sentiments and biases toward them.

<h3>What are the deliverables?</h3>

The delivery is a Jupyter Notebook in HTML. Not to mention there is also a summary of the preprocessing methods, models, predictions, limitations, and results at the end of my notebook.

<h2>BDA 594 Final Project - NFL: Implementing New Special Team Metrics and Ranking Special Team Players</h2>

My part of the final group project for BDA 594.

<h3>Project Description</h3>

We used NNFL data given to us to implement new metrics for Special Teams players. We took the data and ranked the Specialists, a group that is comprised of punters, kickers, and long snappers. Our main objective is to evaluate and rank the performance of the Specialists to draw new insights and uncover any findings that can potentially improve team performance.

<h3>What I did?</h3>

Preprocessed exploratory data and implemented predictions using a simple linear regression model created through an artificial neural network to predict metrics such as:

- Average distance a special team player can travel throughout a game.
- Determine their rate of kick success in a game.

<h2>BDA 572 Individual Final Project - COVID19 Visualization </h2>

This is my individual final project for class Big Data Analytics 572 Python Scripting for Social Science.

<h3>Project Description</h3>

This is an individual final project which is a visualization of COVID-19 data, specifically focused on California and more detailed insights into Los Angeles County. The data is sourced from the New York Times' COVID-19 dataset, which provides information on cases and deaths across US counties. The visualizations include bar plots, line plots, pie charts, scatter plots on a map, and choropleth maps.

<h3>What I did?</h3>

I imported necessary libraries and set up the environment for data visualization. I sourced COVID-19 data from the New York Times' GitHub and merged it with geographical data for US counties. After focusing on California and cleaning the data, I created various visualizations, including bar plots, pie charts, and line plots. Additionally, I used scatter plots to depict cases and deaths on a California map and a choropleth map to show the average number of deaths across California counties.

<h3>Results</h3>

The code offers visualizations detailing the spread and impact of COVID-19 in California, highlighting case distribution, time-based trends in Los Angeles, geographical hotspots, and severity across counties, with a particular emphasis on Los Angeles County.
